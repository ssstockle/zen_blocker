## Overview

Zen Blocker is a Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused by blocking distracting websites. When you try to
visit a blocked site, you'll be redirected to a ~calming~ blocked page with a mindful quote to help you resist the urge
to
doomscroll.

## Installation

### Chrome and Chromium-based browsers

#### Install from source

> [!NOTE]
> I actually paid $5 just to have this extension published on the Chrome Web Store (_small update: they rejected it because of permissions, 
> I didn't re-apply, so go and grab your free .zip here for now hehe_), you ~~can~~ get it from there if you
> want to make Google happy, but if you want to avoid that, just install it from source following the steps below.

1. Download the .zip from the releases tab or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (or your Chromium-based browser's extensions page)
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension icon will appear in your toolbar

## Usage

1. Click the Zen Blocker icon in your browser toolbar
2. Add websites you want to block (e.g., `twitter.com`, `reddit.com`)
3. Try to visit those sites and experience zen instead

x.com;instagram.com;twitter.com;youtube.com;twitch.tv;kick.com;tiktok.com
